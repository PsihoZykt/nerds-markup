Desktop only markup

Trying to pixel-perfect markup of nerd's project 
( psd-file gotten from internet)
It's not really pixel-perfect because I have some issues with text ( All settings of font are right, but anyway it looks a liiitle bit different.
( also psd-file and .png preview I worked with in this markup looks a little different so it makes it harder)

based on cra

I mixed up some styles of file-structure ( Total decomposition for main-menu and top-menu and place entire code in one file for footer. 
I made it intentionally, just for my own purposes. I know, that both styles are bad and mix-up styles in project is incorrect, but for education purposes I did it to show myself why it's bad and when I could use it to make more convenient file-structure

Here you can see that white text has some "shadows" - it's because text on page and text on .png file not corresponding perfectly. I don't know how to fix this, but I guess it doesn't really matter.
