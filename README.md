Desktop only markup

Trying to pixel-perfect markup of nerd's project 
( psd-file gotten from internet)
It's not really pixel-perfect because I have some issues with text ( All settings of font are right, but anyway it looks a liiitle bit different.
( also psd-file and .png preview I worked with in this markup looks a little different so it makes it harder)

Here you can see that white text has some "shadows" - it's because text on page and text on .png file not corresponding perfectly. I don't know how to fix this, but I guess it doesn't really matter.
